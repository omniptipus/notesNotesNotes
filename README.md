# notesNotesNotes
A group of ugly bash scripts I wrote to create TXT files which I use for random notes throughout the day.

Daily_Notes.command - Put this on your dock. When you click it, it will check if there's already a note file created for today. If there is, it opens it in your .txt editor of choice. If not, it creates it.

nopen.sh - I alias this script to just "nopen". Run the script for some help documentation, but essentially you open a specified date or range of dates(./nopen.sh -d 2021-12-20 or ./nopen.sh -d 2021). You can also open notes from the past week or month (./nopen.sh -w, ./nopen.sh -m)

notes.sh - Search ~/Documents/Notes for a string of text. Run the script with no arguments for some useful help documentation.

These are ugly, but I used them as a learning experience and they get the job done. I'm posting them here as my first github project as I learn the absolute basics of the platform.
